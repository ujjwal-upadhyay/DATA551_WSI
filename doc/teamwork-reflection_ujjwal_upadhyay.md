Below, briefly describe the specific contributions each team member made to your project (**including yourself**). Point form is fine. Specifically, comment on the following areas:

- How the team worked together as a whole, including:
    - What was your role in the group? That is, what sort of things did you do to contribute to the evolution of the project?  
    **I was responsible for contributing the R version of dash app alongside of Nowshaba Durrani. We worked as a team to execute it successfully and deployed on Heroku.**    
    - What were the roles of others in your group?  
    **Shveta and Varshita were responsible for executing python version of dash app. They worked together to make it successfully deployed to Heroku.**  
- What went well and poorly throughout the team project experience?  

**Deployment on Heroku for both Python and R version were the roadblocks for us which took lot of time. Apart from that, everything was on track.**
